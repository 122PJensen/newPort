<h3>A bit about the author</h3>

<h3>A word from the Author</h3>

<p>As a kid who's experienced his ups and downs, I have seen many angles on life. There is much to see and only a limited amount of time.
  <br>
  So until I earn enough to make the changes necessary, I start small with these websites. I attend these classes to gain knowledge to use in the world.
  <br>
  And maybe one day, these websites will form an importance to everyday life and provide the world a place to be joyful and safe. So don't forget to smile, and have a positive view on life.
  -Patrick</p>
